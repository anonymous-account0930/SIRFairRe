# Fair Dimension Reduction Experiments

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks that reproduce the main experimental results from our NeurIPS 2025 submission on fair dimension reduction.

We evaluate our proposed methods on four widely studied benchmark datasets from the fair ML literature:
- Adult Income (UCI)
- COMPAS Recidivism (ProPublica)
- German Credit (UCI)
- CelebA (image dataset)

## üìÅ Repository Contents

Each notebook corresponds to one dataset:
- `Adult UCI Experiments.ipynb`
- `COMPAS UCI Experiments.ipynb`
- `GERMAN UCI Experiments.ipynb`
- `CelebA Experiments.ipynb`

These notebooks include all preprocessing steps, model fitting procedures, and visualizations needed to replicate the experimental figures and tables in the paper.

## Requirements

- Python ‚â• 3.8
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- For CelebA: `torch`, `torchvision`

You can install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
